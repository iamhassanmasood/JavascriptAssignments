    <h1>Rape of the Lock</h1>
    <p>
      The Rape of the Lock begins with a passage outlining the subject of the
      poem and invoking the aid of the muse. Then the sun (“Sol”) appears to
      initiate the leisurely morning routines of a wealthy household.<span

        moreLapdogs shake themselves awake, bells begin to ring, and although it
        is already noon, Belinda still sleeps. She has been dreaming, and we
        learn that the dream has been sent by “her guardian Sylph,” Ariel. The
        dream is of a handsome youth who tells her that she is protected by
        “unnumber’d Spirits”—an army of supernatural beings who once lived on
        earth as human women. The youth explains that they are the invisible
        guardians of women’s chastity, although the credit is usually mistakenly
        given to “Honour” rather than to their divine stewardship. Of these
        Spirits, one particular group—the Sylphs, who dwell in the air—serve as
        Belinda’s personal guardians; they are devoted, lover-like, to any woman
        that “rejects mankind,” and they understand and reward the vanities of
        an elegant and frivolous lady like Belinda. Ariel, the chief of all
        Belinda’s puckish protectors, warns her in this dream that “some dread
        event” is going to befall her that day, though he can tell her nothing
        more specific than that she should “beware of Man!” Then Belinda awakes,
        to the licking tongue of her lapdog, Shock. Upon the delivery of a
        billet-doux, or love-letter, she forgets all about the dream. She then
        proceeds to her dressing table and goes through an elaborate ritual of
        dressing, in which her own image in the mirror is described as a
        “heavenly image,” a “goddess.” The Sylphs, unseen, assist their charge
        as she prepares herself for the day’s activities. Commentary The opening
        of the poem establishes its mock-heroic style. Pope introduces the
        conventional epic subjects of love and war and includes an invocation to
        the muse and a dedication to the man (the historical John Caryll) who
        commissioned the poem. Yet the tone already indicates that the high
        seriousness of these traditional topics has suffered a diminishment. The
        second line confirms in explicit terms what the first line already
        suggests: the “am’rous causes” the poem describes are not comparable to
        the grand love of Greek heroes but rather represent a trivialized
        version of that emotion. The “contests” Pope alludes to will prove to be
        “mighty” only in an ironic sense. They are card-games and flirtatious
        tussles, not the great battles of epic tradition. Belinda is not, like
        Helen of Troy, “the face that launched a thousand ships” (see the
        SparkNote on The Iliad), but rather a face that—although also
        beautiful—prompts a lot of foppish nonsense. The first two
        verse-paragraphs emphasize the comic inappropriateness of the epic style
        (and corresponding mind-set) to the subject at hand. Pope achieves this
        discrepancy at the level of the line and half-line; the reader is meant
        to dwell on the incompatibility between the two sides of his parallel
        formulations. Thus, in this world, it is “little men” who in “tasks so
        bold... engage”; and “soft bosoms” are the dwelling-place for “mighty
        rage.” In this startling juxtaposition of the petty and the grand, the
        former is real while the latter is ironic. In mock-epic, the high heroic
        style works not to dignify the subject but rather to expose and ridicule
        it. Therefore, the basic irony of the style supports the substance of
        the poem’s satire, which attacks the misguided values of a society that
        takes small matters for serious ones while failing to attend to issues
        of genuine importance. With Belinda’s dream, Pope introduces the
        “machinery” of the poem—the supernatural powers that influence the
        action from behind the scenes. Here, the sprites that watch over Belinda
        are meant to mimic the gods of the Greek and Roman traditions, who are
        sometimes benevolent and sometimes malicious, but always intimately
        involved in earthly events. The scheme also makes use of other ancient
        hierarchies and systems of order. Ariel explains that women’s spirits,
        when they die, return “to their first Elements.” Each female personality
        type (these types correspond to the four humours) is converted into a
        particular kind of sprite. These gnomes, sylphs, salamanders, and
        nymphs, in turn, are associated with the four elements of earth, air,
        fire, and water. The airy sylphs are those who in their lifetimes were
        “light Coquettes”; they have a particular concern for Belinda because
        she is of this type, and this will be the aspect of feminine nature with
        which the poem is most concerned.</span
